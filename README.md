## 📖 Usage Examples

### Generate a Research Paper
```python
from router import AdvancedResearchPipelineAgent

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = AdvancedResearchPipelineAgent()

# Generate a research paper
topic = "Large Language Models in Scientific Research"
focus_areas = [
    "Automated literature review and synthesis",
    "Hypothesis generation and experimental design",
    "Scientific writing and peer review assistance",
    "Ethical considerations and limitations"
]

# Generate paper (synchronous)
paper_content = pipeline.generate_research_paper_sync(topic, focus_areas)

# Save the paper
filepath = pipeline.save_paper(paper_content, topic)
print(f"Paper saved to: {filepath}")
```

### Run the Pipeline
```bash
# Interactive mode
python router.py

# Choose option 2 for single paper generation
# Enter your research topic when prompted
```

### Parse PDFs and Extract Images
```python
from app import *

# Parse a research PDF
result = parser.parse("research_paper.pdf")

# Extract text content
markdown_docs = result.get_markdown_documents(split_by_page=False)

# Extract and caption images
image_docs = result.get_image_documents(
    include_screenshot_images=True,
    include_object_images=True,
    image_download_dir="./images"
)
```
